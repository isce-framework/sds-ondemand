    "This notebook provides the means by which additional conda environments that support specific science data packages are created local to the user (i.e.'user-local'). The implication of user-local installations is that they are retained across logins and server restarts (since the ~jovyan directory is retained and remounted each time). It also permits the user to customize the environment, again with those changes persisted across sessions.\n",

The prefix is responsible for designating where the environment's contents will reside and if a subdirectory of the user (i.e. jovyan), the environment is user-local. Since the ~jovyan directory is persisted and remounted for each jupyter login, these environments also persist and do not have to be created each time you log into jupyter.\n",
